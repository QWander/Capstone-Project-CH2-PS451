## About The Project
<div style="text-align: justify">The tourism sector is one of the pillars of the Indonesian economy and a major contributor to foreign exchange. Indonesia is experiencing rapid growth in the tourism sector, with an increasing number of tourists visiting. However, the main problem faced is the lack of knowledge of tourists about the tourist attractions available in the city. This can interfere with their travel experience, especially since tourists tend to rely on general information found on the internet. Such information often does not match the personal preferences of each traveller. Therefore, this capstone project aims to create a tourist spot recommendation system that can provide recommendations that match the individual preferences of tourists. The main research question is: Whether the use of a tourist spot recommendation system can improve the experience of tourists in Indonesia according to their preferences? The development of this recommendation system is not only expected to increase the satisfaction of tourists visiting Indonesia, but also has the potential to promote new tourist attractions in the city. This will help support the growth of Indonesia's tourism sector, creating sustainable benefits for tourists and tourism stakeholders in the city.<br/><br/>
This capstone project was initiated by our team in response to the significant growth of the tourism sector in Indonesia and the problem faced by tourists, which is the lack of knowledge about local destinations that affects their experience. We designed and developed a recommendation system that can provide personalized travel recommendations to each tourist based on their preferences. In addition to improving the tourist experience, the system is also used as a tool to promote lesser-known tourist destinations in Indonesia, with the hope of supporting the development of the local tourism sector.
